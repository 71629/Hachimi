Game enhancement and translation mod for UM:PD.

<img height="400" src="assets/screenshot.png">

# Features
- **High quality translations:** Hachimi comes with advanced translation features that help translations feel more natural (plural forms, ordinal numbers, etc.) and prevent introducing jank to the UI. It also supports translating most in-game components; no manual assets patching needed!

    Supported components:
    - UI text
    - master.mdb (skill name, skill desc, etc.)
    - Race story
    - Main story/Home dialog
    - Lyrics
    - Texture replacement
    - Sprite atlas replacement

    Additionally, Hachimi does not provide translation features for only a single language; it has been designed to be fully configurable for any language.

- **Easy setup:** Just plug and play. All setup is done within the game itself, no external application needed.
- **Translation auto update:** Built-in translation updater lets you play the game as normal while it updates, and reloads it in-game when it's done, no restart needed!
- **Built-in GUI:** Comes with a config editor so you can modify settings without even exiting the game!
- **Graphics settings:** You can adjust the game's graphics settings to make full use of your device's specs, such as FPS unlocking and resolution scaling.
- **Cross-platform:** Designed from the ground up to be portable, with Windows and Android support.
